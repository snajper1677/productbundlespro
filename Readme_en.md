PRODUCT BUNDLES PRO
====================
for Prestashop by Musaffar Patel

Introduction
------------

Product Bundles Pro allows you to cross sell products on your store by grouping them into bundles and tabs and offering a discount when selected products are purchased as a bundle straight from your product pages. It's a great way to increase your average cart order value and make it easier for customers to buy a group of products from one page.

Installation
------------
The installation procedure is very much similar to most other Prestashop modules. No core changes required therefore installation is straight forward, be sure to follow the instructions below to ensure a successful installation.

1. Upload the module folder to your store {root}/modules folder
2. Once uploaded, login to your Prestashop Back Office and head over to the “Modules” section
3. Search for the module and click Install
4. After a successful installation, the module configuration screen is presented to you. More details on this in the next section

Configuration
-------------
The module configuration allows you to set up your global configuration options. From this screen you can set up your tabs.

**What are tabs and do I need them?**
Merchants who wish to create a large number of bundles to be displayed on the product page could potentially end up confusing or frustrating customers with a large list of bundles to scroll through.  Therefore the module allows you to group your bundles under specific tabs.

For example, if you're selling bed frames and with it you wish to offer bundle products such as Bed Frame + Mattress or Bed Frame + Pillows you could create tabs such as "Memory Foam Mattresses", "Spring Mattresses", "Pillows" and so on. Helping keep your product page organised and easy for your customers to find what they need quickly.

If your product page makes use of only one tab, then tabs will be hdden by default.. Tabs are only displayed when there is more than one tab available. You'll learn how to set up tabs and bundles for your products later in this document.

**Add a tab**
If you've decided you will need tabs, go ahead and click the "Add a tab button" and enter the title of your tab.. Add as many tabs as you think you
wil need. You can always come back to this screen later if you need to add more.

Creating your bundles
---------------------
After creating your tab head over to a edit product for which you wish to create bundles for. On the edit product page open the new tab "Product Bundles Pro".

Because we haven't yet created any bundles you will see an empty list with a button below labeled "Add a Bundle". Click the button and a popup should appear as show in the screenshot.

**"Choose a tab"**
As mentioned earlier, each bundle you create will be grouped under tabs. If all your bundles are grouped under the same single tab, then no tabs will be displayed on the product page. Choose a tab from the
dropdown under which you wish to displayed the bundle under.

**"Add a product"**
Each bundle can have one or products added to them. When the customer adds the bundle to the cart, the parent product along with all the products you added to bundle will be added to the cart together. Go ahead, click the "add a product button and you should see some more options appear:

**"Search"**
Start typing in the name of the product you want to add. As you type, a list will appear from which you can select the product to be added.

**Apply a discount of**
Products purchased as part of a bundle can be discounted. It's a great incentive to offer your customers. You can set up two types of discounts : a percentage based, or a fixed amount.

**After setting up your discount, click "done" and then "save" Your bubndle should now be listed under the list of bundles.**
